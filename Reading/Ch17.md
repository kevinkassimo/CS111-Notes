# Chapter 17 Free-Space Management
+ free space management is difficult when
  + the free space consists of variable-sized units
  + arise in
    + a user-level memory-allocation library e.g. malloc
    + OS implementing segmentation
  + problem: __External Fragmentation__
    + free space \-\-> little pieces of different size \-\-> fragmented
    + request for free space may fail even if *total* free space is enough...

### Assumptions before discussion
  + malloc, free \-\-> on heap, managed by some __free list__
  + concern external fragmentation, ignore internal for now
  + assume no relocation, compaction
  + assume allocator manages a contiguous region of bytes & fixed size (no size growth)

### Low-level Mechanisms
  + __Splitting__
    + request for a certain size
    + find a free chunk of memory
    + split it into two, one fits the requested size
  + __Coalescing__
    + continuous free space
    + merge the free space chunks
  + Tracking Allocated Region Size
    + Why must have? e.g. free(void \*str) takes NO size argument
    + __header__ block
      + immediately before the handed-out chunk of memory
      + contents:
        + size
        + magic number: provide additional integrity checking
      + because of header, search free space MUST add size of header
    + When splitting the free space, a new header would be generated at the front of the unused part, specifying the new size (size won't include the size of the header, however)
    + When freeing, notice that the pointer calling for free points at the start EXCLUDING the header (first address immediately after the header)
    + After freeing, fragmented? Coalesce!!!
  + Growing the heap
    + when heap runs out of space?
      + `sbrk` system call to grow the heap
        + find free physical pages
        + map them into the address space of the process
        + return value of the end of the new heap

### Basic Strategies
  + __Best Fit__
    + search through the free list
    + find chunks with size >= required size (best fit chunk)
    + Problem:
      + searching cost
      + quick fragmentation
  + __Worst Fit__
    + find the largest chunk and return the requested amount
    + Slower fragmentation
    + Problem:
      + still search through
      + performs badly
  + __First Fit__
    + Find the first block that is big enough and returns the requested amount
    + Good: speed
    + Problem:
      + pollutes the beginning of the free list w/ small objects
      + solution:
        + use *address-based ordering*, make coalescing easier
  + __Next Fit__
    + maintain a pointer (guessing pointer) to the NEXT chunk of previously chosen one and search from there
    + avoid splinter at the beginning & fast (no need for full search)
  + __Segregated Lists__
    + if a particular application has popular-sized request that it makes, keep separate lists just to manage object of those sizes
    + When a given cache is running low on free space, it requests some __slabs__ of memory from a more general memory allocator
    + when the reference counts of the objects within a given slab all go to zero, the general allocator can reclaim them from the specialized allocator
  + __(Binary) Buddy Allocation__
    + free memory is first conceptually thought of as one big space of size 2^N
    + When a request for memory is made, the search for free space recursively divides free space by two until a block that is big enough to accommodate the request is found
    + Possible internal fragmentation since you can only allocate space of 2^N
